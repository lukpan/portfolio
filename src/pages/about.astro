          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            I started my career in education as a high school computer science teacher, where I discovered my passion for making complex technical concepts accessible and engaging. Teaching 150+ students annually taught me that effective learning isn't just about delivering information—it's about creating experiences that stick.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            In 2022, I formalized my instructional design skills with a graduate certificate in Educational Design, diving deep into learning theory, assessment strategies, and evidence-based instructional methods. This academic foundation, combined with my classroom experience, prepared me for the next chapter of my career.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
            At commercetools, I found the perfect intersection of my technical background and instructional expertise. Here, I've had the opportunity to completely reimagine how we create and deliver technical learning content. By embracing AI tools like GPT-4 and Claude, I've built systems that have reduced content creation time by 70% while actually improving quality and consistency.
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What I Do</h2>
          
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            I specialize in creating scalable learning systems that blend traditional instructional design principles with cutting-edge AI technology. My work ranges from building conversational AI mentors that guide learners through complex topics to designing comprehensive curriculum architectures that serve thousands of developers worldwide.

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            I believe that the best learning experiences emerge when we combine human expertise with AI capabilities. Technology should amplify our ability to create meaningful, personalized learning journeys—not replace the human touch that makes education transformative.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
            Every project I tackle starts with a simple question: "How can we make this easier to understand and more engaging to learn?" Whether I'm designing a conversational AI mentor or structuring a technical curriculum, I'm always focused on reducing cognitive load while maximizing retention and application.
